- 👋 Hi, I’m @MikeWymore
- 👀 I’m interested in developing software of all sorts, I am most comfotrable in Python, Java, C, and SystemVerilog.  I would also enjoy an oppurtunity to refine my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS by working on a webpage project at some point.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python skills specific to RFR testing development to add to-and maintain the Impinj RFR testing suite.  I am also learning about how servers work and how different devices communicate with eachother over internet interfaces.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of different projects that would allow me to apply my coding skills and learn.
- 📫 How to reach me **mwymore@impinj.com**
